## *Do they have code examples?*

The summary pages are intentionally concise, and do not provide definitions or code examples of topics.
Their intent is simply to bring to mind the concept and examples when the key word of the concept is presented. This aids recalling concepts already studied or mastered, as opposed to re-reading what you already know.

## *Are these cheat sheets?*

These summaries are different from Cheat Sheets in that they are more spread out and allow the reader to write their own comments and additions based on their need.
